Rust implementation of the One-Time-Pad encryption algorithm

This is very unfinished. Do not attempt to encrypt anything yet...
I am basing the design of this program from the `minigrep` example in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) and [this](state_diagram.mmd) state diagram I made using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/).
